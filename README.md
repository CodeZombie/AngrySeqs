# AngrySeqs
### Arduino-based MIDI sequencer

## What is it?
AngrySeqs is a hardware device that can be connected to a music synthesizer to automatically play dynamic patterns of notes called *sequences*.

Patterns can be built from scratch by the user, or generated randomly by the sequencer then modified later. Multiple sequences can be played simultaneously to create even more complex patterns.

## Features
* Fully hardware interface
* Can hold 16 patterns simultaneously
* Play multiple patterns at once
* Generate random sequences
* Randomize any parameter of any sequence
* Midi-output for music hardware, and usb-serial midi output for [Hairless Midi](https://projectgus.github.io/hairless-midiserial/)
